abstract = {Abstract In order to make district heating systems competitive in areas with single family houses or in other areas with low heat demands it is necessary to reduce the heat losses from the pipes. In recent years the twin pipe has become popular in the Nordic countries. In the article we describe how the heat loss and the heat loss coefficients can be calculated. We introduce the triple pipe with three media pipes (two supply pipes and one return pipe). The temperature dependency and the ageing of polyurethane insulation are briefly discussed. A comparison is made for different 80 mm distribution pipes and for different service pipes with respect to heat losses and to resources, i.e. materials needed for the casing and polyurethane insulation and the gravel in the excavations. For the distribution pipe we found that an egg-shaped twin pipe can reduce the heat loss by 37\% and the investments by 12\% compared with a pair of single pipes. For the service pipes we found that the triple pipe reduces the heat loss by 45\% compared with a common pair of single pipes and by 24\% compared with circular twin pipes. The reduction in investment index is 21\%. The article also addresses the question of the heat exchange between the two media pipes in a twin pipe. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
