    - Absolute heat work: new test cases to be added, and some existing test cases to be updated - wait for this to be completed before updating to much comments
    - Decoupled from absoulte heat can update comments now: gas test, elec test, insulation, hydraulic power, max size and optional assest, testpycml, setpointconstraints, descriptions of heat problems in all,

r"""
This is a test to check the behaviour of the cumulative investments made and the
asset is realized variable. We want the asset only to become available once sufficient
investments are made.

In this specific test we optimize to match the heat demand. However, the sources are not
available from the start as the cumulative invesments made at timestep 0 is 0. Furthermore,
there is a cap on the investments that can be done per timestep. We expect the optimizer
to find a solution that releases the sources as soon as possible in order to match demand
and the demand not to be matched until that point in time.

     possible insulation levels), and only specify 1 insulation level (which must be active) for

     is insulated to reduce heating demand to below production capacity, but for other reasons
     should not insulate (reality this would be a case where the costs of insulation are
     relatively high thus insulation that is not cost efficient --> thus keeping high deltaT)(e.g.
     test with minimise pipe diameter, or minimize flow at sources)
    2b. Test as 2, but instead of not having enough production capacity in total, not having
     enough production capacity at standard network temperatures, such that network temperature of
     one hydraulically decoupled network should be reduced by insulation houses and thus reducing
     Tmin at those demands, such that lower network temperature can be chosen (again with minimize
     flow at sources) (e.g. still not cost efficient to insulate otherwise)
    3. Test to select LT sources (which have lower cost, but only possible if Tmin of demands is
     low enough)
    4. Test in which not all LT sources are selected as Tmin of demands is not low enough
     --> maybe 3 and 4 can be combined --> so forinstance only LT source behind HEX is selected due
     to insulation of that Heating demand, but other HD can not be insulated far enough for LT
     source on the primary network.(e.g. goal, minimise heat loss, does not solve the provided
